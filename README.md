# Multiple Mailgun Domains in one Laravel app

Sending email through Mailgun is a breeze, so long as you're sending from **one domain** only.   
For any additional domains, the _calling code_ needs to determine which mailer transport to use.   
This can be especially annoying if the mailer to use depends on the sender, which is set inside the mailable.   
This can lead to a lot of repeated code, a helper, or service, you need to copy between projects.   

> Using this package, the _calling code_ is no longer concerned with the configured mailers.    

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

// So this
Mail::mailer('mailgun-acme.tld')->to(...)->queue(...);

// Can be as simple as this
Mail::to(...)->queue(...);
```

## The solution

This package contains a listener that hooks into the `Illuminate\Mail\Events\MessageSending` event, which is dispatched _just before_ sending the e-mail.   
It then reconfigures the current `Transport`, based on the `from` domain in the message. This works for direct and queued messages alike, with no extra configuration!   

> This package will only affect e-mails sent through the `mailgun`-mailer. Any other channels will be left untouched. 

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require skitlabs/laravel-mailgun-multiple-domains
```

### Requirements
There are a few requirements for this to work;

* PHP 8.0, or 7.4
* Laravel >= 8.0 (although it will _likely_ work on any version >= 5.5)
* Laravel needs to use `swiftmailer/swiftmailer` internally (default)
* Your configured mailer (for mailgun) is named `mailgun` (default)

## Usage

If you've configured mailgun under `mg.{domain.tld}`, and your secret works for all domains you are sending from; you're ready to start sending e-mail! üëç     

Let's say you're sending a message as `sales@acme.app`. Just before sending the message, this package will set the mailgun domain to: `mg.acme.app`.    

> Thanks to Laravel's auto-discovery (‚ù§), no assembly required!   
   
### What if I need to customize my settings, per domain?
If you have mailgun configured at custom subdomains, need multiple API secrets, or to switch between endpoints;   
All you have to do is add the sending domains to your mailgun configuration in the key `domains`.       

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

// config/services.php

return [
    // ... Other services

    'mailgun' => [
        'domain' => env('MAILGUN_DOMAIN'),
        'secret' => env('MAILGUN_SECRET'),
        'endpoint' => env('MAILGUN_ENDPOINT', 'api.mailgun.net'),
        'domains' => [
            'example.net' => [
                'domain' => 'custom-mg-domain.example.net',
                'secret' => 'overwrite-the-secret-or-null',
                'endpoint' => 'overwrite-the-endpoint-or-null',
            ],
            'awesome.app' => [
                'secret' => 'only-change-the-secret-for-this-domain',
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```

> If a domain is not specified, it defaults to `mg.{domain.tld}`.    
> If the `secret` or `endpoint` are not configured, these fallback to your configured global defaults.    

### What if I need to customize how these settings are determined?
If the standard way of resolving sender properties is not suitable for your use-case, create a custom resolver that implements [MailGunSenderPropertiesResolver](src/Contracts/MailGunSenderPropertiesResolver.php). See the [default implementation](src/Resolvers/MailGunSenderPropertiesFromServiceConfigResolver.php) for inspiration.   

Once you have your own concrete implementation, overwrite the default bind in any of your service providers;

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use SkitLabs\LaravelMailGunMultipleDomains\Contracts\MailGunSenderPropertiesResolver;

// app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php
class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        // ...

        $this->app->bind(MailGunSenderPropertiesResolver::class, static function () : MailGunSenderPropertiesResolver {
            return new \Acme\CustomSenderPropertiesResolver();        
        });
    }
}
```
